# Entertainarr

The goal of this project is to do a multimedia platform, like sonarr, radarr, lidarr and jellyfin, but in the modern world.
It will bring some capabilities that are present on the -arr suite, like the ability to subscribe to shows, movies, singers and groups but the filesystem will not have to be local.
Some people now have some cloud storage (aws, proton drive, google drive, nfs or anything else) where they store their multimedia files, so this software should interface with that.
